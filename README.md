### Projects

#### Data Science Final Project
This project aims to explore the relationship between the development level of countries and their environmental and sustainability policies. Data from over 200 countries, spanning from 1990 to 2023, was used, covering various socio-economic and environmental factors. The data was cleaned and organized using the data.table and tidyverse packages. To analyze the relationship between the selected environmental and socio-economic indicators, cluster analysis was performed. Regression and decision tree models were then applied to capture both linear and non-linear relationships. The results were visualized using the ggplot2 package to highlight trends at the country level. The project seeks to provide actionable insights into the key socio-economic factors that affect global sustainable development.
