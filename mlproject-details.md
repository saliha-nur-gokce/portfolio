# **Machine Learning Final Project Details**

This project analyzes the predictive power of **machine learning models** for forecasting **quarterly U.S. GDP growth**, comparing them with the traditional **Autoregressive (AR(4)) model**. Additionally, it examines the impact of key economic indicators on GDP growth, assessing their positive or negative influence. The dataset includes macroeconomic variables from the **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)**, covering the period from **1970Q1 to 2020Q1**.

## **Data and Feature Selection**

The dataset consists of **21 economic indicators**, including inflation, private investment, unemployment rate, and current account balance. To improve predictive accuracy, we conducted **feature selection** using **Random Forest (RF)** and **Gradient Boosting (GB)**, ranking the most influential features based on their impact on GDP growth. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** was also applied to reduce dimensionality while preserving essential information.

To examine the relationships between these features, we computed the **correlation matrix**, which highlights the dependencies among macroeconomic variables. This helped us identify **redundant features** and refine our selection for model training.

To further refine feature selection, we used **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** feature importance rankings. These models identified the most influential predictors based on how much each variable reduces prediction error.

These visualizations highlight the variables that contribute most to GDP growth forecasting, forming the basis for our predictive models.

## **Machine Learning Models and Benchmarking**

The analysis compares **three models**:

- **AR(4) Model:** Uses the last four GDP growth values to make predictions, serving as a baseline.
- **Random Forest (RF):** An ensemble learning method that reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees.
- **Gradient Boosting (GB):** A sequential model that improves accuracy by focusing on previous prediction errors.

The models were trained on data from **1970Q1 to 2012Q4** and tested on **2013Q1 to 2020Q1**. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** was used as the primary evaluation metric.

## **Model Performance and Key Findings**

The results show that **machine learning models outperform AR(4)** in GDP growth forecasting:

- **Gradient Boosting achieved the lowest test MSE (0.113), followed by Random Forest (0.120), while AR(4) performed the worst (0.157).**
- **RF and GB models were more effective in capturing sudden economic changes**, whereas AR(4) failed to adapt to fluctuations.
- **Feature importance analysis** highlighted **private investment change, labor productivity, and inflation** as the most critical predictors of GDP growth.

## **Model Interpretation and SHAP Analysis**

To understand the impact of features on GDP growth, we used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values**. The analysis revealed that:

- **Private investment change** has the strongest **positive** effect on GDP growth.
- **Labor productivity change** is another key driver of economic expansion.
- **Unemployment rate and public debt** have **negative** contributions to GDP growth.
- **Gradient Boosting provided the most stable and interpretable feature importance rankings.**

## **Forecasting and Visualizations**

The forecast comparison shows that:

- **AR(4) struggles with capturing GDP volatility**, often smoothing out fluctuations.
- **RF and GB track GDP movements more closely, especially during economic shocks.**
- **Density plots highlight how key features behave during periods of high and low GDP growth.**

Density graphs were obtained for the common best 5 features selected by the RF and GB models on the basis of good and bad years. The distinction between good and bad years was made by determining the threshold of 0.69%, which is the average quarterly growth value between 1970Q1-2019Q4. Quarters above this threshold value were selected as good growth, and quarters below this threshold value were selected as bad growth periods.

## **Limitations and Future Work**

While the models provide valuable insights, several limitations should be considered:

- **Prediction accuracy remains moderate**â€”models capture overall trends but struggle with precise short-term fluctuations.
- **Alternative data sources,** such as business sentiment surveys or global financial indicators, could enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Neural networks and deep learning** approaches could be tested to determine whether they offer further improvements.
- **Expanding the feature set** to include geopolitical factors or trade dynamics may refine predictions.
- **Time-series cross-validation** could improve the robustness of future models by ensuring better generalization across different economic conditions.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates that **machine learning models significantly outperform traditional econometric methods** in GDP forecasting. **Gradient Boosting consistently produced the most accurate results**, highlighting its ability to capture non-linear relationships in economic data. 

Additionally, **SHAP analysis and KDE visualizations** provided deeper interpretability, offering valuable insights into how economic factors influence GDP growth. While traditional econometric models like AR(4) remain useful for capturing long-term trends, **machine learning models offer a more adaptive approach**, making them better suited for analyzing complex economic systems.

Despite its successes, the project also revealed limitations in predictive power, emphasizing the need for **further improvements in data selection, alternative modeling techniques, and validation strategies**. Future research should explore more advanced machine learning architectures and richer datasets to enhance GDP forecasting accuracy.
